# ElectroMart – AI-Powered Multi-Agent Customer Support System

ElectroMart is a full-stack AI-powered e-commerce assistant designed to handle **product inquiries, recommendations, promotions, order tracking, returns, and technical support** using a multi-agent architecture.

The project is structured as a **monorepo** with separate frontend and backend applications, each having its own setup and documentation.

## System Overview

ElectroMart uses an **agent-based AI architecture** where user messages are routed to specialized agents based on intent:

- **Sales Agent** – product specs, pricing (LKR), availability, recommendations
- **Marketing Agent** – promotions, discounts, campaigns
- **Orders Agent** – order tracking, delivery, returns, refunds
- **Support Agent** – troubleshooting, warranty, setup, support tickets
- **Purchase Agent** - Creates sales leads by capturing user purchase intent in chat

Intent routing is **deterministic, memory-aware**, and protected by automated accuracy tests.

---

## Key Features

- AI-driven conversational shopping experience
- Deterministic intent routing with ≥85% accuracy enforcement
- PostgreSQL + pgvector for product and order data
- Clear separation of concerns using multiple AI agents
- Fully testable and reproducible backend logic
- Frontend and backend developed and deployed independently

---

## Frontend

The **frontend** provides the user interface for interacting with the ElectroMart assistant.

**Location:**  
`frontend/`

**Setup & usage:**  
See **[`frontend/README.md`](./frontend/README.md)** for:
- Tech stack details
- Installation steps
- Development & build commands
- UI behavior

---

## ⚙️ Backend

The **backend** powers the AI agents, intent routing, database access, and APIs.

**Location:**  
`backend/`

**Setup & usage:**  
See **[`backend/README.md`](./backend/README.md)** for:
- Environment configuration
- Docker & database setup
- Running the API server
- Intent routing evaluation & tests
- Architecture details

---

## Quality & Testing

- Intent routing accuracy is evaluated using a labeled dataset
- Automated tests enforce a **minimum accuracy threshold**
- Regression-safe design for AI routing logic

(Full testing instructions are available in the backend README.)

## Notes

- Each folder (`frontend`, `backend`) is independently runnable
- Please follow the README inside each folder for setup
- Backend tests demonstrate deterministic AI behavior and measurable quality guarantees
